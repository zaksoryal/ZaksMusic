Zak's Music is a webpage that includes a live, 24 hour feed of what music I'm listening to, along with statistics about my general listening history.
This is a personal project I, Zak Soryal, developed for experience in web development (namely JavaScript and HTML), API integration, and website management.
It utilizes Last.fm's public API, which captures my listening 24/7 through an app called Marvis Pro and a Last.fm integration add-on. 
Hopefully I'm listening to something good when you visit! Thanks for stopping by :)
